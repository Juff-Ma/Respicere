# Respicere
Respicere *(latin: to look back)* is a self hosted surveillance system that uses a webcam attached to the computer as Camera.

Currently it only takes photos but it will support video recording soon.
To run it, grab the zip file from the Releases page and run it, then open the ip and port shown in the console.

### Why?
I didn't find something that worked like i wanted it. And in fact most of the systems i found wouldn't even start.
### How?
Respicere is based on FlashCap for recording, ImageSharp for Transcoding and Blazor as a frontend.

## TODO
**Very near future:** add GitHub actions and Docker support
**Near Future:** add video recording

**Maybe sometimes:** Add person recognition, create dektop and/or mobile apps
